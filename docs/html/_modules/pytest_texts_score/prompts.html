<span class="sd">Prompt templates used by pytest-texts-score.</span>
<span class="sd">These prompts are carefully engineered to guide the LLM&#39;s behavior for question generation and evaluation. Modifying them may have significant impacts on the scoring results.</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="n">QUESTION_PROMPT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;You are a meticulous text analysis assistant. Your task is to generate **yes/no questions** that reflect the information explicitly or implicitly contained in a given text.</span>

<span class="s2">### OBJECTIVE</span>
<span class="s2">These questions will be used to **compare the informational overlap** between texts. Therefore, your questions must:</span>
<span class="s2">- Be **factual**, **specific**, and **clearly answerable as YES** based only on the content of the provided text.</span>
<span class="s2">- Reflect the **relative importance and frequency** of information in the text.</span>
<span class="s2">- Cover the entire content.</span>

<span class="s2">### FORM &amp; STYLE REQUIREMENTS</span>
<span class="s2">- **Every question must start with “Does the text”** and end with a **question mark**.</span>
<span class="s2">- Each question must be **true** (i.e., answerable with YES) according to the text.</span>
<span class="s2">- **Do not use pronouns** like &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;. Always rephrase into specific entities.</span>
<span class="s2">- Questions must be as **specific as possible**, while including enough **context** to be meaningful if read independently.</span>
<span class="s2">- Create **one or more precise** questions for each distinct piece of meaningful information.</span>
<span class="s2">- Cover the entire text thoroughly—ensure that no sentence, clause, or relevant detail is left unaddressed.</span>
<span class="s2">- The number of questions for information must respect the importance of the information in the text. For example, if a list is given and the list is important in the context, then ask for each item in the list in separate questions.</span>
<span class="s2">- Maximise the number of questions to cover **every sentence** and the whole text fully.</span>
<span class="s2">- Return **only valid JSON** in this format:</span>

<span class="s2">{</span>
<span class="s2"> &quot;1&quot;: &quot;Does the text...?&quot;,</span>
<span class="s2"> &quot;2&quot;: &quot;Does the text...?&quot;,</span>
<span class="s2"> ...</span>
<span class="s2"> &quot;200&quot;: &quot;Does the text...?&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">}</span>
<span class="s2">---</span>

<span class="s2">### EXAMPLES ###</span>

<span class="s2">#### Example 1:</span>
<span class="s2">Input:</span>
<span class="s2">Text: &quot;Marie Curie discovered radium and polonium. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.&quot;</span>

<span class="s2">Output:</span>

<span class="s2">...</span>
<span class="s2"> &quot;75&quot;: &quot;Does the text say that a woman won a Nobel Prize?&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">}</span>


<span class="s2">#### Example 2:</span>
<span class="s2">Input:</span>
<span class="s2">Text: &quot;The Amazon rainforest is home to millions of species. It plays a critical role in regulating the Earth&#39;s climate.&quot;</span>

<span class="s2">...</span>
<span class="s2"> &quot;250&quot;: &quot;Does the text suggest that the Amazon&#39;s ecosystem is significant for the Earth&#39;s climate?&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">}</span>

<span class="s2">#### Example 3:</span>
<span class="s2">Input:</span>
<span class="s2">Text: &quot;The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 for the World&#39;s Fair in Paris. It stands 300 meters tall.&quot;</span>

Your task is to assess how closely a given **list of questions** corresponds to a provided text.

<span class="s2"># TASK</span>

<span class="s2">- You are an attentive and detailed assistant who objectively analyses text exactly according to instructions.</span>
<span class="s2">- Our ultimate goal is to compare the similarity of information between texts.</span>
<span class="s2">- Your goal is to help us with one particular task - answer the YES/NO questions **based purely on a given text**. You will proceed according to a specified criterion in the CRITERION section.</span>
<span class="s2">- Based on the criterion, you must answer in the format specified in the FORMAT section.</span>
<span class="s2">- Your answer must be truthful.</span>
<span class="s2"> </span>
<span class="s2"># CRITERION</span>

<span class="s2">Given a text, your goal is to answer each of the given YES/NO questions according to the text. Only use information found within the text as the basis of your answer.</span>
<span class="s2">You must return the text of the question and answer as a number.</span>
<span class="s2">Respond with a valid JSON in this format:</span>

<span class="s2">        ...</span>
<span class="s2">    ]</span>
<span class="s2">}</span>
<span class="s2">The answer must be </span>
<span class="s2">1 - The information in the question is **fully and exactly present** in the text. There are no missing details and no contradictions.</span>
<span class="s2">0.5 - The information is partially present, but about half of it is missing, incorrect, or contradicted.</span>
<span class="s2">0 - The information is not present at all in the text.</span>
<span class="s2">0.75 - The information is mostly present, but with a small omission or minor inaccuracy. This is stronger than 0.5, but not fully correct like 1.</span>
<span class="s2">0.25 - The information is slightly present, but most of it is missing or inaccurate. This is stronger than 0, but weaker than 0.5.</span>

<span class="s2">Do not lower the score if the question is missing all the details. The score must be decreased only for missing information in the text from the relevant question.</span>
